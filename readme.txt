This plugin allows you to create users with custom password on multisite website.

== Description ==
By default Wordpress does not allow you to create users with custom password on multisite website. This plugin will add password fields to new user form on individual multisite website so that you could type in new user's password. However, please be warned that it is not advised by Wordpress due to possibility of registering users to network they should not belong to and possibity of resetting existing user's password.

== Installation ==
1. Upload 'multisite-new-user-form' to the '/wp-content/plugins/' directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress (you can activate this plugin only on multisite website).
